# Test Reporting

This project includes automated test reporting in both JUnit XML and HTML formats for RSpec and Cucumber tests.

## CI/CD Test Reporting

Test reports are automatically generated during GitHub Actions CI runs:

- **RSpec XML**: `reports/rspec-results.xml`
- **RSpec HTML**: `reports/rspec-results.html`
- **Cucumber XML**: `reports/cucumber/` (directory with multiple XML files, one per feature)
- **Cucumber HTML**: `reports/cucumber-results.html`

These reports are uploaded as artifacts and retained for 7 days.

## Local Test Reporting

Generate test reports locally:

```bash
# Generate RSpec reports (XML + HTML)
bundle exec rspec --options .rspec_ci

# Generate Cucumber reports (XML + HTML)
bundle exec cucumber
```

For normal testing without generating reports:

```bash
# RSpec (no reports)
bundle exec rspec
```

All reports are created in the `reports/` directory (which is git-ignored).

## Viewing Reports

**HTML Reports** (easiest to view):
- **RSpec**: Open `reports/rspec-results.html` in your browser
- **Cucumber**: Open `reports/cucumber-results.html` in your browser

**XML Reports** can be viewed in:
- **CI Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.
- **IDEs**: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code (with extensions)
- **Reporting Tools**: Allure, ReportPortal, etc.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage reports are automatically generated by SimpleCov:
- Location: `coverage/index.html`
- Open in browser to view detailed coverage metrics
- Uploaded as artifacts during CI runs
