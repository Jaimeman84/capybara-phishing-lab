# Test Reporting

This project includes automated test reporting in JUnit XML format for both RSpec and Cucumber tests.

## CI/CD Test Reporting

Test reports are automatically generated during GitHub Actions CI runs:

- **RSpec**: `reports/rspec-results.xml`
- **Cucumber**: `reports/cucumber/` (directory with multiple XML files, one per feature)

These reports are uploaded as artifacts and retained for 7 days.

## Local Test Reporting

Generate test reports locally:

```bash
# Generate RSpec report (use CI config)
bundle exec rspec --options .rspec_ci

# Generate Cucumber report (uses default profile from cucumber.yml)
bundle exec cucumber
```

For normal testing without generating XML reports:

```bash
# RSpec (no XML report)
bundle exec rspec
```

All reports are created in the `reports/` directory (which is git-ignored).

## Viewing Reports

JUnit XML reports can be viewed in:
- **CI Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.
- **IDEs**: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code (with extensions)
- **Reporting Tools**: Allure, ReportPortal, etc.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage reports are automatically generated by SimpleCov:
- Location: `coverage/index.html`
- Open in browser to view detailed coverage metrics
- Uploaded as artifacts during CI runs
